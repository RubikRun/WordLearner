Today I finished refactoring word sets section of UI into
    WordSetsWidget

----------

Before this refactoring side quest began
I wanted to implement editing of notes.
And I wanted to do it with a context menu that pops up when user does right click on a word
and contains an option "Edit note" and later would contain "Delete word" and other options.

So now let's do this context menu with an "Edit note" option.
Okay I made the context menu with an "Edit note" option that currenty does nothing.
Next time, make it pop up a dialog for editing the note.

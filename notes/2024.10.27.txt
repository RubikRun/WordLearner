Last time I started writing this new function
    std::string breakIntoMultipleLines(const std::string str, int maxLineLength = 80);
in new files
    StringUtils.h
    StringUtils.cpp
in project Utils.
Let's finish it now.
Done.
Let's try to use it for the tooltips.
Okay, it works.

And one final thing, let's style the tooltips a little better.
A stylesheet cannot be set to a tooltip directly because it's not a widget,
but it can be set to the whole application.
So let's create a new .css file
    Application.css
Load it in ResourceManager,
and set it to the application in
    main.cpp
like that
    application.setStyleSheet(ResourceManager::getApplicationStylesheet().c_str());
Okay, looks good now.
Displaying a word's note is done.

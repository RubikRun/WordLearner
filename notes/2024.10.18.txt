I looked through the changes one more time
and tested it, it works.
I tested it by adding 2 words in each word set,
closing the application,
confirming that .data files are updated,
opening the application again to confirm that new words will be loaded correctly.
So it's ready. Adding a new word is fully ready.
Let's commit.


Now let's continue with implementing adding a new word set.
Hopefully it will be similar, but simpler since a word set doesn't have any other object containing it.
Start by adding another "New" button, this time under word sets list widget.
Done, easy, looks good.

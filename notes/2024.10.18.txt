I looked through the changes one more time
and tested it, it works.
I tested it by adding 2 words in each word set,
closing the application,
confirming that .data files are updated,
opening the application again to confirm that new words will be loaded correctly.
So it's ready. Adding a new word is fully ready.
Let's commit.


Now let's continue with implementing adding a new word set.
Hopefully it will be similar, but simpler since a word set doesn't have any other object containing it.
Start by adding another "New" button, this time under word sets list widget.
Done, easy, looks good.

Now let's create a dialog that will open up when this "New" button is clicked
    CreateWordSetDialog.h
    CreateWordSetDialog.cpp
    class CreateWordSetDialog
Copy contents of .h and .cpp file from
    CreateWordDialog.h
    CreateWordDialog.cpp
We need basically the same thing but just with 1 line edit for the set's name, for now.
Done, easy, looks good.
Does nothing yet, but the correct signal in WordLearnerMainWindow is called with the entered name.

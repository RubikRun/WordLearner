Today it's time to implement adding a new word.
First in Database, then in UI.

For Database create a new function
    bool addWord(const Word& word);
Inside of it this is the essential thing
    m_words.push_back(word);
Other than that, check if word's ID is valid and unique
and add word to global word set.
I also added a new member variable
    int m_globalWordSetIndex = -1;
that keeps the index of the global word set,
so that we don't have to do this every time:
    findWordSet(0)

DONE: Currently word's IDs are unique and word sets IDs are unique
      but they are not checked for uniqueness across each other,
      meaning that we can have a word and a word set with the same ID.
      That's not good.
      We want IDs to be unique across all objects.
      Implement a global ID existence check.

DONE: I also noticed a bug.
     The global word set is created internally in Database, it doesn't exist in data file,
     but then we export it to data file at the end. We have to not do that.
     I will go back and fix it in the corresponding commit.

Another function that we'll need in Database when user adds a new word through UI
is a function for adding a word to a word set.
Because user will have selected a word set
and when they add a word we want that word to be added to the selected word set.
So add a new function to Database
    bool addWordToWordSet(int wordId, int wordSetId);
Implement it. The essential line there is
    wordSet->words.push_back(wordId);
Other than that check if word and word set exist and check if word is not already in word set.

Now I have all the API that I need in Database.
Time to do the UI.
Add a QPushButton after the words list.
Now connect button to a new slot
    void onCreateWordButtonPressed();
Inside of that slot I should open a small dialog asking user to enter new word.
User will have to enter 3 separate strings - termA, termB, note
I tried doing it temporarily with 3 calls to
    QInputDialog::getText()
It works but it shows this annoying warning message in console
    QWindowsWindow::setGeometry: Unable to set geometry 120x30+841-620 (frame: 136x69+833-651)
    on QWidgetWindow/"QInputDialogClassWindow" on "DELL P2722H". Resulting geometry: 178x96+841-620
    (frame: 194x135+833-651) margins: 8, 31, 8, 8 minimum size: 178x96 maximum size:
    524287x96 MINMAXINFO(maxSize=POINT(x=0, y=0), maxpos=POINT(x=0, y=0), maxtrack=POINT(x=524303, y=135),
    mintrack=POINT(x=194, y=135))
and it looks kinda bad,
so I better implement a proper dialog with 3 line edits.
Do that next time.

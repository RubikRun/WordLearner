Yesterday I started to write a ResourceManager namespace
with a function for loading all resources,
for now only a CSS file for list widgets.
Let's finish that and then finish styling the actual list widget.
Done, list widget looks better, still not final but good for now.

Now let's add another list widget for the word sets.
It should be horizontally next to the words list, to the left of it.
For now let's just show the data sets from database.
Done, pretty easy, and it looks good.

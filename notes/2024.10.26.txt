I now finished the editing of words by calling the new Database API in the new UI slot.
Tested it. It works.
Editing of words is ready now.

I found a bug. When user adds a word to global word set,
it is added to database but not shown in UI (UI is not updated).
Let's fix that now.
Done.

DONE: Print an ERROR message when user tries to rename the global word set.

Now let's do this old TO-DO
TO-DO: Create a new .data file that will contain name of language A and name of language B,
    load it in Database,
    and those names for the columns of the words table widget.
By the way, those names of language A and language B can also be used in CreateWordDialog.

Start by creating the .data file.
    languages.data
and let's just have 2 lines containing the 2 language names.
Then load the 2 languages in Database into these 2 new member variables
    std::string m_languageA;
    std::string m_languageB;
with a new function
    void loadLanguages(const std::string& dataFilepath);
that is called from
    loadDatabase()
Then we will need getters for the 2 languages
    std::string getLanguageA() const;
    std::string getLanguageB() const;
And finally we can use those 2 languages in UI.
Done. It works.

I now finished the editing of words by calling the new Database API in the new UI slot.
Tested it. It works.
Editing of words is ready now.

I found a bug. When user adds a word to global word set,
it is added to database but not shown in UI (UI is not updated).
Let's fix that now.
Done.

TODO: Print an INFO message when user tries to rename the global word set.

Now I need to finish implementing loadWords() and loadWordSets() in Database.
Last time I managed to open file and read it line by line. Now I need to process each line.

It seems like a good idea to have the number of objects written on the first line of each .data file.
That way when we load .data files we can first read the number of objects and allocate memory for that many objects,
instead of adding them one by one and having our memory grow dynamically.
Not that it matters much, our .data files will probably contain at most 10k objects, but still.
Of course, separators.data is a special case, we don't need to have the number of objects there.

DONE: When loading words check for uniqueness of IDs
DONE: When loading word sets check for uniqueness of IDs
DONE: When loading word sets check if words list contains existing IDs

I also added functions
    printWords()
    printWordSet()
for printing all loaded words and word sets to the console

TODO: In Database in parseListInt() make the first written thing be the number of elements so that we can allocate memory more effeciently.

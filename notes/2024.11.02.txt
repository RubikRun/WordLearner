Okay, there's a problem here in my function parameters logic.
This class
    WordsWidget
inside of its constructor requires a function pointer to a member function of this class
    WordSetsListWidget
but this class itself inside of its constructor requires a function pointer to a member function of
    WordsWidget
So whichever we create first will be a problem
because we will still not have a valid pointer to the other.
The only solution here is to not set these function pointers in the constructors of the 2 classes.
Instead we can have set..Callback() methods or better yet have the whole initialization logic
inside a method
    init()
instead of in the constructor.
That was a bit messy but it's ready now.
I refactored the word sets list logic into a class
    WordSetsListWidget

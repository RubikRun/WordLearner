Continue from last time.
Let's create a dialog that will pop up when user clicks on "Create new word" button.
This dialog should consist of 3 line edits
- termA
- termB
- note

Create new .h/.cpp files in WordLearner project
    CreateWordDialog.h
    CreateWordDialog.cpp
and just implement it, it's kinda straightforward.

Now we have a dialog that opens up when user clicks on "New" button.
User can enter new word's data in this dialog and press "Create word" button
which calls this new slot in WordLearnerMainWindow
    void onCreateWord(const std::string& wordA, const std::string& wordB, const std::string& note);
so this is the function that should actually create the word with the received data and update UI.

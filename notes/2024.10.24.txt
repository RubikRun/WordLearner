Last time I started implementing editing of words,
but first I had to make words be displayed in a table instead of a single list.
That's ready and now I can continue with the actual editing of words.

First, make table's cells be editable (I made them non-editable last time, for consistency)

Now let's create a slot that will be called when a cell is edited, similar to
    onWordSetEdited()
but for the table.

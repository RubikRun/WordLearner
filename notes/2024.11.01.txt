Last time I finished displaying a word's note.

Now let's think about editing of a word's note.
How would user edit a word's note?
We can't really allow editing inside the tooltip where the note is displayed.

I guess the best option would be to have a context menu that pops up
when user does right click on a word,
and that context menu will contain an "Edit note" option
that will make a small QDialog pop up for editing the word's note.
This context menu will also be useful later to put a "Delete" option
and probably other options in the future, so let's do it.

Let's first do the actual context menu in UI with an "Edit note" option
that calls a slot when clicked.

Maybe now is a good time to refactor the UI code a little bit
by separating the words table into its own class
    class WordsTableWidget
in new files
    WordsTableWidget.h
    WordsTableWidget.cpp
Okay, done.
Only interesting thing was that I had to pass a callback function
to WordsTableWidget's constructor
for retrieving ID of currently selected word set.
    std::function<int()> getSelectedWordSetIdCallback
and since this is a member function of WordLearnerMainWindow
and it's specific to an instance of that class
I had to pass this callback as argument using std::bind like that
    ui.wordsTableWidget = new WordsTableWidget(
        m_database,
        std::bind(&WordLearnerMainWindow::getSelectedWordSetId, this),
        this
    );
Now I'm wondering if it makes sense to add the createWordButton
to that class as well.
I kinda want it to be refactored as well, but it kinda doesn't belong to this class
because it's a "table" class only.
So let's create one more class
    WordsWidget
in files
    WordsWidget.h
    WordsWidget.cpp
that will contain all widgets for interacting of words,
for now WordsTableWidget and createWordButton.
Okay, done, nothing interesting to say here.

While we're at it,
let's also refactor the word sets part of UI
to have everything cleanly separated.
Create a new class
    WordSetsListWidget
in files
    WordSetsListWidget.h
    WordSetsListWidget.cpp

I want to create a desktop application with GUI that helps me learn words in a foreign language.
My choice of technologies is C++ with Qt because I have experience with that and I use it at work.

Let's plan what the application is going to do exactly.

First I will plan and implement version 0.1 which will be a minimalistic version
doing only the bare minimum but in a solid way so that it can be a good base for future development. 


=============================================================================================================================
1. Database
=============================================================================================================================
Database is loaded when user launches the application,
and it's exported when user closes the application.

1.1 Word
The most basic piece of data is going to be a word.
A word consists of:
- int id: Unique ID across all objects in the application
- string aTerm: The word in language A
- string bTerm: The word in language B
- string note: Some additional note, explanation, or example

1.2. WordSet
A bunch of words grouped together by user, is called a word set.
A word set consists of:
- int id: Unique ID across all objects in the application
- string name: The word set's name
- list<int>: A list containing IDs of all the words of the word set


=============================================================================================================================
2. UI
=============================================================================================================================
When user launches the application, they will be presented with the main window.

2.1. Main Window
The main window consists of:
- A list of word sets, specifically their names.
    - A button for adding a new word set
    - Support editing word set's name directly in the list
    - Next to each word set there will be a delete button for deleting that word set.
- A list of words in the selected word set, serialized in some way that shows their aTerm, bTerm and note.
    - A button for adding a new word to the selected word set
    - Support editing a word directly in the list
    - Next to each word there will be a delete button for deleting that word.

Basically user should be able to easily see, create, update and delete words and word sets.

There will be a global word set, called "global" with id=0.
This global set will contain all words in the database.
User will not be able to rename or delete the global set.
User will be able to see, create, update and delete words in the global set.
When user creates a word in another set, it will automatically be added to the global set.
When user deletes a word from another set, it will be removed from that set but not from the global set.
If user wants to delete a word globally, they can delete it from global set or from any other set while holding down Shift.

This concludes version 0.1.

Last time I finished displaying a word's note in a tooltip.
Now let's add on a small feature to that which is
to color words that have a note a little differently
so that user can know which words have a note without hovering over each one and checking.

First let's do it with a hardcoded color.
Then I want to create a Config class and .config file where such data can be stored and load the color from there.

Okay, wait, this is basically impossible to do in Qt with my current setup
because I'm setting a stylesheet to my QTableWidget and it overrides all dynamic style changes.
I researched a bit on the internet and indeed it's not possible.

So let's think of some other way to indicate which words have a note.
Maybe let's not overthing it and just put an asterisk after the word in language A.
Okay yeah, that's it, looks good enough.

Then we will need functions for loading the words and word sets from data files
    void loadWords(const std::string& dataFilepath);
    void loadWordSets(const std::string& dataFilepath);
These functions will be private, we will expose a single public function in Database
    void load();
that loads the whole database.
Before implementing these 2 functions we will need to have a list of separators.
It's more convenient that it's a single string, instead of a list of characters
    std::string separators;
and a function that reads them from their data file.
    void loadSeparators(const std::string& dataFilepath);
Again this function will be private and called from load().
Inside of load() we should call all other load*() functions and pass the filepaths to the corresponding data files.
The default working directory in a Visual Studio project is
    $(ProjectDir)
but let's make it be
    $(SolutionDir)
so that we can write filepaths like this
    loadSeparators("Database/data/separators.data");
    loadWords("Database/data/words.data");
    loadWordSets("Database/data/word_sets.data");

We have a problem with displaying cyrillic characters on the console.
Solution is to tell console to use UTF-8 in main.cpp, with this:
    #include <windows.h>
    ...
    SetConsoleOutputCP(CP_UTF8);

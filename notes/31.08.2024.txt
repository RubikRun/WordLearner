Decided how to name the application - WordLearner.
Created a GitHub repository called WordLearner.
Created a default Qt C++ project in Visual Studio.
Planned the application's architecture, functionality and UI.

Moved source fles and header file from $(SolutionDir) to a new directory
    src
Moved .ui file and .qrc file to a new directory
    src\QtResources
Set project's output directory to
    $(SolutionDir)bin\$(Configuration)_$(Platform)\
Set project's intermediate directory to
    $(SolutionDir)bin\intermediate\$(Configuration)_$(Platform)\

Create a new empty project called Database.
Set Database's Configuration Type to be
    Static library (.lib)
Set Database's output directory to
    $(SolutionDir)bin\$(Configuration)_$(Platform)\
Set Database's intermediate directory to
    $(SolutionDir)bin\intermediate\$(ProjectName)\$(Configuration)_$(Platform)\
Now looking back to it, it's better to also set WordLearner's intermediate directory to be this
    $(SolutionDir)bin\intermediate\$(ProjectName)\$(Configuration)_$(Platform)\
so that the 2 projects can have separate intermediate directories but both under the same bin directory.
Inside Database project create a new directory
    src
and inside of it create a header file and a source file
    Database.h
    Database.cpp
Declare and implement some example function
    void databaseFunction();
Now I can build Database project and a file Database.lib is created in the output directory.
Let's link this library to WordLearner and try to call databaseFunction().
First add this to WordLearner's include directories
    $(SolutionDir)Database\src\
Then add this to WordLearner's library directories
    $(OutDir)
and finally add this to WordLearner's dependencies
    Database.lib
Now in WordLearner in main.cpp I can successfully include Database's header
    #include "Database.h"
and call the example function
    databaseFunction()
and it works!

By the way, the default Qt C++ project in Visual Studio is created without a console, just a GUI window.
I want to have a console together with the window.
Enabling a console is done by going to
    Project Settings -> Linker -> System
and setting SubSystem to Console

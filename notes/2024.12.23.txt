I did a big pause of ~50 days, because I had other side projects going on.
But now let's continue.

Last time I made a context menu that pops up when user right clicks on a word.
It contains a single option - "Edit note".
Currently it does nothing.
Let's create a small dialog that pops up when that option is clicked.
This dialog should contain a text edit with the current note,
that can be edited,
and an Ok button for saving the new note and closing the dialog.
Done.

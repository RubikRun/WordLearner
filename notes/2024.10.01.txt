Last time I finished Database. It's ready for version 0.1.

Today I will start working on UI.
For now I only have an empty main window.

Let's begin by creating a single list widget that contains all words.
First of all, I removed the .ui file. I will not be using Qt Designer. I will create my UI elements in code.
Then I tried creating a QListWidget and a QHBoxLayout
    QHBoxLayout* layout = nullptr;
    QListWidget* wordsListWidget = nullptr;
and setting main window's layout like that
    setLayout(layout)
but it doesn't work. It gives me this error when I run it
    QWidget::setLayout: Attempting to set QLayout "" on WordLearner::WordLearnerMainWindow "", which already has a layout
Quick googling tells me that I can't directly set a layout to a main window.
Instead I should have a central widget of the main window and set layout to that central widget.
Fortunately I do NOT have to have a whole separate member for the central widget like that
    QWidget* centralWidget = nullptr
Instead QMainWindow already has such a member and I can access it with
    centralWidget()
    setCentralWidget()
So I think it's appropriate to do
    setCentralWidget(new QWidget);
    ...
    centralWidget()->setLayout(ui.layout);
Then I created a function
    void createWordsListWidget()
in WordLearnerMainWindow for creating the list widget and filling it with the words from database.
I also had to create a getter for the words list in Database class
    const std::vector<Word>& getWords() const
and for consistency let's create the same getter for the list of word sets. I will need it later.
    const std::vector<WordSet>& getWordSets() const
Then in createWordsListWidget() I can just create the QListWidget normally and fill it with the words from database.
Done, it works.
Looks a bit bad tho, let's style it better next time.

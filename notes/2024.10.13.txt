So let's make addWord() and addWordSet() return ID instead of bool.
Okay, a little quiestionable design, but ok for now.
Actually no, let's make it good.
addWord() and addWordSet() shouldn't be responsible for generating ID.
We should have a function for adding a Word object with an already created ID,
and a function for creating a Word object and its ID from given data and adding it to the list.
So let's bring back addWord() and addWordSet() to returning bool, and let's move generating of ID
in createWord() and createWordSet().
Okay, I think it's ready. Next time test.

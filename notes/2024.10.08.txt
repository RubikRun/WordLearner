Let's continue from last time.
I was in the middle of implementing
    onWordSetChanged()
Now I tested that the retrieved wordSetId is correct.
So now what to do with that wordSetId?
Use the new Database API, to get word set's words as Word objects instead of int IDs
    database.getWordsFromWordSet(wordSetId)
Now we will need to update words list widget with this new words list.
We currently do this same logic in createWordsListWidget() but with all words from database.
So I need to refactor this logic of updating list widget with a new list of words,
and use it both in createWordsListWidget() and in onWordSetChanged().
Let's create a new function
    void updateWordsListWidget(const std::vector<Word>& words)
that updates the contents of words list widget with a given list of words.
Use that function in createWordsListWidget().
And finally use it in onWordSetChanged() to update words list widget with the words from set.
That's it.
It works.

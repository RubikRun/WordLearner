Let's look for that bug now.
This one:
    TO-DO: Fix bug. Adding one word works, but trying to add a second one adds the first one again.

I found one thing that's wrong.
In updateWordsListWidget() we add word IDs to m_wordsListIds,
but we don't clear this list in the beginning of the function.
Fixed that, but it was not the bug.

I found the bug.
In createWord() we generate an ID for the new word
but we don't update m_maxId.
Maybe doing this manually every time we add a word to m_words or a word set to m_wordSets
is not a good idea.
It'd be better if we have a function that adds a new word,
takes care of generating an ID if needed,
and takes care of updating m_maxId.
So let's create these 2 new private functions
    bool addWord(Word word);
    bool addWordSet(WordSet wordSet);
and replace all manual push_back()s in m_words and m_wordSets with those 2 functions.
I also added the check for uniqueness of ID to be inside those 2 functions
instead of directly in loadWords() and loadWordSets().
Okay I found a problem now.
The function createWord() no longer returns the newly generated ID
because what actually generates the ID is addWord()

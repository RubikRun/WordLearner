Today let's do this old TO-DO:
    TO-DO: In Database in parseListOfInt() make the first written thing be the number of elements so that we can allocate memory more effeciently.

First of all, let's rename parseListOfInt() to be parseIntList(), sounds better.
Now let's just implement it, kinda straightforward.
Only thing to think about is what to do if the count is invalid.
I did it with 2 separate checks.
First, count could be < 0, in this case I just don't allocate memory in the beginning,
and I let vector allocate its memory dynamically as it grows.
Second, count could be >= 0 and we will allocate that much memory, but the actual elements might be more/less.
We can't really do anything in this case, just in the end check if the resulting list
has as many elements as the count, and if it doesn't log a warning.
It's not really a problem, everything will still work perfectly fine,
just a sanity check and a bit of optimization.

(later, came back, 2024.09.30) I forgot to implement this in serializeListInt(),
and rename it to serializeIntList()
